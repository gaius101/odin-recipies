    <h2>Description</h2>
     <p>This easy tzatziki sauce recipe is rich, creamy, and tangy and adds fresh flavor to any meal. Use on gyros or a Greek salad, or serve alongside a crudit√© platter for dipping. Tastes best when chilled for at least 1 hour after preparation.<p>
     <p>To ensure extra-thick tzatziki, make sure your yogurt is thick to begin with. You can use any type of yogurt and strain it yourself in the fridge. Just set a fine sieve lined with cheesecloth over a bowl. Add yogurt, cover, and refrigerate until the liquid drains off, 8 hours to overnight.</p>
